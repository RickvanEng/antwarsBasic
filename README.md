Simple base project to get going with AntWars.
It establishes a connection for you and shows some details of how to access game info. 
It sends empty moves for your ants, so nothing is happening yet. 

If you start the game, and then redirect your browser to the board on the AntWars site you can see the board visualization. 
This might be really helpful if your ants are dying and you don't know why.
